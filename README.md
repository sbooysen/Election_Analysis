# Election_Analysis
Module 3: Python
## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete lit of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7, Visual Studio Code

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and (85,213) number of votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and (272,892) number of votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and (11,606) number of votes.
- The winner of the election was:
    - Candidate Diana Degette, who received 73.8% of the vote and (272,892) number of votes.
## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, there were multiple things to consider, such as how many candidates there were, what the total votes were overall and for each person, as well as calculating all the data to present it in a more consumable way. 
## Challenge Summary
Overall, the challenge involved a lot of troubleshooting and reformatting. The indentations in python are very sensitive and need to be properly used to get the correct results. Once the formulas are in place, however, the coding comes together. We were able to determine that Diana DeGette was the winner of this particular election, and we were able to determine that the runner up was Charles Casper Stockham, with Raymon Anthony Doane coming in last. We succeeded in providing concise data to help the Board of Elections employee analyze the data.
